> [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator


## Getting Started

### Install Yeoman

Yeoman lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. To install:

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

### About

This generator is intended for a quick and dirty prototyping. I created it so I could use it whenever I wanted to try something new out. It wasn't build with flexibility in mind.

### Dependencies

For simplicity this generator assumes you have Android SDK version 21 installed. If you have a different version installed you can change the targetSdkVersion on your generater AndroidManifest.xml so the project works.

### Install generator-android-minimal

To install generator-android-minimal from npm, run:

```bash
npm install -g generator-android-minimal
```

### Use the generator

Create a new folder and run:

```bash
yo android-minimal
```
